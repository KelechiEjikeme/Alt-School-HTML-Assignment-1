    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Kelechi Ejikeme, and I am a member of the AltSchool of Engineering 
    Tinyuka cohort, and my specialty is Front end Engineering. I have a BSc in Biology and 
    I am currently transitioning into Tech. I am transitioning as a means of upskilling, as 
    well as, entering a field that holds promises and opportunities.</p>
    
    <p>When I wanted to begin this journey, I knew that 
    learning on youtube alone was not going to be enough, and so I searched for self-paced, 
    affordable online schools where I could learn and Network, and I came across AltSchool on 
    Twitter. My goal is to master software engineering within this one year, build my portfolio, 
    network with my colleagues and graduate with a very good result.</p>
